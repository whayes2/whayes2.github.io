  <h2>Welcome to the website containing my favorite things!</h2>

    <p>My name is William Hayes and my pronouns are he/him/his. I currently live in Madison when attending university and live in Eau Claire, WI when I am not at school! Eau Claire has a very cool shop called Volume One where they sell lots of locally made clothes, games, and cheese (of course). If you wish to take a look at some of the cool things this store has to offer, click on this link: <a href="https://www.thelocalstore.org" target="_blank">https://www.thelocalstore.org</a>.</p>

    <p>I am currently attending UW Madison's School of Engineering with the intended major of Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in biomechanics. I took my first LIS class last semester and loved it so I decided to take the next level class this semester!</p>
