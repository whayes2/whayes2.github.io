  <h2>Some of my favorite memories are spent with friends from back home and in Madison!</h2>

    <p>I have a very fun friend group from back home in Eau Claire that I love to hang out with. We all love playing Spikeball, going to the beach, or just playing games for hours on end. I have attached some pictures from over the summer with my friends back home.</p>

   <p>I also met a bunch of new people when I came to college in Madison. The picture below is a picture with my engineering team from my first semester engineering design course. We were tasked with solving a very real issue of growing plants in space. With the help of the UW Astrobotany Lab, my team brainstormed, designed, and prototyped a chamber that would use capillary action to help tomatoes grow in space!</p>
