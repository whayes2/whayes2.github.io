  <h1 title="Header">Spending Time With Family</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>When I am not fishing, studying, or with my friends, I am spending time with my family!</h2>

    <p>My family consists of my mother (a yoga instructor), my dad (a hand surgeon), my sister (a genetic counselor), my brother (looking at colleges to pursue the sciences), and myself. My family is very active and competitive, which makes them very fun to spend time with. We play board games every night after dinner. This is a habit that we got into that I love. On the weekends, or when it is nice out, we play tennis, pickle ball, or frisbee golf.</p>

It was always fun growing up and learning how to drive stick shift 
in a fun car like that!</p>

 <p>This was a picture taken of my family over Christmas break. 
I am not looking forward to the crazy cold weather that comes 
with WI winters.</p>
